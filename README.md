Red Hat Lightspeed cost management API cheat sheet
==================================================

This repository contains a [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) collection with examples of the Cost Management API.

Look at the [Red Hat Lightspeed API cheat sheet](https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/red-hat-lightspeed-api-cheat-sheet) to get started with authentication, base URLs, etc.

You will need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add proper values for `client_id` and `client_secret` 
or the queries in this Bruno collection will fail due to lack of authentication.
